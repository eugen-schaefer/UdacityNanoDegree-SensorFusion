# Sensor Fusion Nanodegree Programm

This repository contains the code for the Sensor Fusion Engineer Udacity Nanodegree Program. 

Computers use sensors in orer to perceive the world around them, and in particular, robots use many of different types of sensors in order to understand and build a model of their environment. Perception, as this task is called allows the robot to navigate through the environment and update its understanding of its surroundings as it goes.

Different sensors have different strengths and weaknesses. Some sensors have a very far range and some sensors can only see the immediate souroundings. Some sensors can see in 360 degrees or more up and down, whereas some other sensors can only see a straight line out and back. Fusing together all of these data from all of these different sensors enables an autonomous system to understand the world more fully and build a complete picture of the environment in which it is operating. 

The goal of this course is to learn to detect obstacles in lidar point clouds through clustering and segmentation, apply thresholds and filters to radar data in order to accurately track objects, and augment your perception by projecting camera images into three dimensions and fusing these projections with other sensor data. Combine this sensor data with Kalman filters to perceive the world around a vehicle and track objects over time.

Four courses comprise the Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree Program:

 * [Lidar](https://github.com/eugen-schaefer/UdacityNanoDegree-SensorFusion/tree/main/Lidar)
 * [Camera](https://github.com/eugen-schaefer/UdacityNanoDegree-SensorFusion/tree/main/Camera)
 * Radar
 * Kalman Filters
 
The first three courses focus on different sensor modalities, and the final course focuses on how to fuse together data from these different sensors to develop a synthesized understanding of the world. Each course in this program concludes with a project.
