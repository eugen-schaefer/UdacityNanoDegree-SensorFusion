%% Part 1 : 1D FFT

% Generate Noisy Signal

% Specify the parameters of a signal with a sampling frequency of 1 kHz 
% and a signal duration of 1.5 seconds.

Fs = 1000;            % Sampling frequency                    
T = 1/Fs;             % Sampling period       
L = 1500;             % Length of signal
t = (0:L-1)*T;        % Time vector

% Form a signal containing a 50 Hz sinusoid of amplitude 0.7 and a 120 Hz 
% sinusoid of amplitude 1.

S = 0.7*sin(2*pi*50*t) + sin(2*pi*120*t);

% Corrupt the signal with zero-mean white noise with a variance of 4
X = S + 2*randn(size(t));

% Plot the noisy signal in the time domain. It is difficult to identify
% the frequency components by looking at the signal X(t).

% Compute the Fourier Transform of the Signal.

Y = fft(X);

% Compute the 2 sided spectrum P2. Then compute the single-sided spectrum
% P1 based on P2 and the even-valued signal length L.

P2 = abs(Y/L);
P1 = P2(1:L/2+1);

% Define the frequency domain f and plot the single-sided amplitude 
% spectrum P1. The amplitudes are not exactly at 0.7 and 1, as expected,
% because of the added noise. On average, longer signals produce better 
% frequency approximations

f = Fs*(0:(L/2))/L;

%% Part 2 - 2D FFT

% Implement a second FFT along the second dimension to determine the 
% doppler frequency shift.

% while reshaping a 1D signal to 2D we need to ensure that dimensions match
% length(X) = M*N

% First we need to generate a 2D signal
% Convert 1D signal X to 2D using reshape
M = length(X)/50;
N = length(X)/30;

X_2d = reshape(X, [M, N]);

% Compute the 2-D Fourier transform of the data. Shift the zero-frequency 
% component to the center of the output, and plot the resulting 
% matrix, which is the same size as X_2d.
